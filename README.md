# AlexNet implementation in PyTorch


This is an implementation of AlexNet architecture proposed by Alex Krizhevsky et al. in the paper [ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf) using PyTorch.

The Jupyter Notebook contains details about the architecture and implementation steps, the Python script contains the code.
